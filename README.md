## üìå What is JavaScript?

JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, dynamic programming language that powers the interactive behavior of websites. It runs directly in the browser and allows developers to create responsive interfaces, validate forms, animate elements, and much more.

---

## üöÄ Why Learn JavaScript?

- It's the **language of the web**‚Äîused by virtually every website.
- JS is essential for **frontend development** and increasingly used on the **backend** (Node.js).
- It enables **interactivity**, **animations**, and **real-time updates**.
- Learning JS opens doors to frameworks like **React**, **Vue**, and **Angular**.

## üß¨ What is the DOM?

The **Document Object Model (DOM)** is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. JavaScript interacts with the DOM to dynamically update the UI without reloading the page.

Example:  
```js
document.querySelector("#button").addEventListener("click", () => {
  alert("Button clicked!");
});
```

## üìÅ How to Add a JavaScript File

To contribute a new mini project:

1. **Create a new folder** inside the `projects/` directory with a descriptive name.
2. Add your HTML, CSS, and JS files inside that folder.
3. Make sure your HTML file links to your JS file like this:

## ‚öôÔ∏è What Is a JavaScript Engine?

A **JavaScript engine** is the program that executes JS code. Every browser has its own engine:

| Browser      | JS Engine     |
|--------------|---------------|
| Chrome       | V8            |
| Firefox      | SpiderMonkey  |
| Safari       | JavaScriptCore|
| Edge         | Chakra (legacy) / V8 (current) |

These engines parse, compile, and run your JS code efficiently.
